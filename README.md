# Basic-Signup-and-Login

<h2>
The basic repo of this repo is creating the Login and SignUP pages with MongoDB as backend so that if anyone wants to create a project where login and signup are the basic requirements they can clone this repo and star working from the actual part of their project without wasting their time on creating login and signup pages with MongoDB connections.
